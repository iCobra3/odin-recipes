    <p>
        Kebab is a popular dish originating from the Middle East, with variations found in cuisines across the world. It
        typically consists of seasoned meat—such as lamb, beef, chicken, or fish—grilled or roasted over a flame or on
        skewers. Vegetarian versions also exist, using ingredients like paneer, tofu, or vegetables. The word "kebab" is
        derived from the Arabic word "kabab," meaning "to burn or roast."
